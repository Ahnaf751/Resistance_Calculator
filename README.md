# Resistance Calculator GUI

This is a simple Python project that calculates the resistance of a circuit using user input for voltage and current. It uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with `tkinter`.

## - Features -
- Super simple interface
- Calculates resistance using Ohm's Law (V/I)
- Handles errors like zero current and non-numeric input
- Has a Clear All button to reset inputs

## - Technologies Used -
- Python 3
- tkinter
